CHANGELOG:
  0.1: (Current) Initial build.
    2 extra warp levels.
    Removal of altitude limits on all worlds.
    
TO DO:
  Currently this does not work until you load a ship for the first time. So if you load a new game and go right to the tracking station, you'll not be able to reach the 2 new warp limits. If you load a ship, though, you will, even if you then to back to the tracking station.
  Trying to modify the time warp settings anywhere else gives me an error, and I've not yet figured out how to get around it.
