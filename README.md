# CHANGELOG:
  - 0.1: (Current) Initial build.
    - 2 extra warp levels.
    - Removal of altitude limits on all worlds.
    
# TO DO:
  - Nothing! If I find no bugs, this will go to 1.0 and never get touched again except recompiles.

# MIGHT DO:
  - Add a config so you can set your own warp rates. Doubtful, as that seems to be where Krakens lie. I think it's better to have this mod as a stalwart, simple addition to the game and if you want more control, use one of the other warp configuring mods instead.
